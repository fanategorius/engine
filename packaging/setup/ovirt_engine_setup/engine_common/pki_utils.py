    # LEGACY NOTE
    # Since 3.0 and maybe before the CA certificate's
    # notBefore attribute was set using timezone offset
    # instead of Z
    # in this case we need to reissue CA certificate.
    #
    # py cryptography does not currently allow getting
    # a certificate's notBefore/notAfter timezone - its
    # docs say it returns "A na√Øve datetime". So we can't
    # use it to verify old certs' timezone. Hopefully that's
    # not needed anymore, because upgrade to 3.5.4 should have
    # prompted the user to renew PKI, and even if they initially
    # postponed this renewal, by now it should have been done.
    # CA Cert is set to expire in 10 years.
    # The only risk is with people that used the old code and
    # still didn't renew.
    # TODO: Either decide that this is ok and remove above
    # comment, or implement this check - either by fixing
    # py cryptography to support timezones or by using other
    # means, such as calling the openssl utility, e.g.
    # openssl x509 -in ca.pem -noout -startdate
